Notice of documenting Chapter 13 liquidation remains on your credit report for a long time, regardless of whether you have satisfied all obligations in the 3-to 5-year window. Another issue is that released obligations stay on your credit report for a long time after they are released. As a rule, that implies they will in any case be on your credit report — even after you have finished Chapter 13 insolvency. 

There are approaches to start modifying your FICO rating rapidly subsequent to declaring financial insolvency. Getting an anchored charge card is the initial step.
